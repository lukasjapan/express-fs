## ExposeFS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gchaincl/exposefs.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/gchaincl/exposefs)

Let's RESTify your filesystem

## Usage

`./bin/expose [path] [port]` will serve path (~ by default) at port (8000 by default).

As _exposefs_ has been built as an express middleware, you can use it to your existing express application.

```javascript
var express = require("express");
var app = express();

var exposefs = require("exposefs");

app.use("/fs", exposefs({ basepath: "/home/" }));

/* your routing definition */

app.listen(8000);
```

The code above will serve your `home` directory under `/fs` url.
